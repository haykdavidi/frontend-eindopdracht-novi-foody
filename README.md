For more information about the API and to obtain your own key, visit [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/).

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase is used for secure email and password authentication. To set this up, you'll need to configure your Firebase project and update the project settings in the application with your Firebase API key and credentials.
